## PREREQ
GCC should be installed and added to the PATH.

For Windows. Install GCC from either [MinGW-w64](https://www.mingw-w64.org/) or
[Cygwin](https://sourceware.org/cygwin/)

## HOW TO RUN
After installing gcc, navigate to any data structure folder. For example:
```bash
cd linkedlist/
```

Then either run `compile.sh` or `.\compile.bat` (For Windows) from the terminal.
This will compile the files and will put the binaries in `./bin`

Then run `./run.sh` or `.\run.bat` (For Windows)
